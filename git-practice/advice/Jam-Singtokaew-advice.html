                <h4>Be Patient</h4>
                <p>Take your time on each lesson. Do not rush to get pass it and always make sure you totally understand 
                    the main purpose of each lesson before you move on. I found it was easy to follow "WHAT TO DO" part
                    step-by-step. However when I have to start something on my own without having the "WHAT TO DO" list, 
                    it could be quite challenging. So take your time to really understand each lesson.
                </p>

                <h4>It takes a lot of discipline!</h4>
                <p>Each one of us has so many things to do in life. Sometimes I question if I really to study today or
                Should I be spending my time doing something else that I will see the result quicker? There will be one of those days.
                Don't give up! Make learning part of your daily routine and try to keep up with it. Trust the system and believe in yourself.
