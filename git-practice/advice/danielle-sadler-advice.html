                    <h4>Do a little bit of programming every day!</h4>
                    <p>Coding is learning another language, and learning any language takes practice. In order to get more 
                    comfortable using the language, set up the habit of practicing the language of coding every day.
                    This will mean being uncomfortable because you <strong>are</strong> going to make mistakes. You are
                    also getting in the habit of being uncomfortable every day while keeping the goal in sight of getting more
                    more and more comfortable with coding.</p>

                <h4>Start to think of yourself as a programmer.</h4>
                <p>What are the characteristics that you want to embody as you move into tech? Start to be those things before
                    you're ready. Read articles, follow people in technology, use affirmations - find the things that help you
                    see yourself in the process of achieving the goals you want to achieve by starting a tech career.</p>

                    fears. Join or create a positive community that can support the amazing things that you're doing!</p>
