    <h1><b>Hi, my name is Brian and I have some advice for you!</b></h1>
      <h4><b>Confusion is your friend!</b></h4>
        <p>One of the best things you can do while learning is to get comfortable being uncomfortable with what you’re learning. 
          As you add little things here and there over the course of your learning this new skill you’ll eventually end up looking 
          back each time saying “Oh that’s what that did” or “Ah now that makes sense.” Trust the process and have fun getting a 
          little lost and finding your way again!</p>

          <p> </p>
      <h4><b>Find other resources.</b></h4>
        <p>While I’m learning I can’t spend as much time as I want on the course. To supplement I bought books on the course, 
          found YouTube channels, podcasts and audiobooks so that I can continue to immerse myself in what I’m learning. This 
          really helps me to continue to develop interest and understanding in programming.</p>
      <h4><b>Review your goals.</b></h4>
        <p>Periodically reviewing my goals and the reasons why I’m learning this skill helps me stay motivated. I want my time 
          back to spend with my loved ones rather than working long days all week and hardly seeing them. Whatever your reason is, 
          keeping it right in front of you can help you stay motivated.</p>
