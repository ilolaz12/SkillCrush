            <h4>Google is your friend!</h4>
            <p>No one has every term memorized. While some will become second nature remember that google is your best
                friend. It's ok and best practice to use resources if you can't remember a step while becoming a front
                end developer.</p>

            <h4>Avoid Distractions</h4>
            <p>I find it easier to focus when I have some quiet, non lyrical music playing while I have noise cancelling
                headphones on. If I'm feeling fancy I'll have a chai latte ready to sip. Figure out what helps you focus
                while coding and don't forget to take a break every once in awhile!
