            <h4>How to Keep Moving When Coding!</h4>
            <p>Mental fatigue is something you may come across more often than you'd like! I've found that the
                best way
                to keep one's mind fresh and productive is to take breaks whenever slowing down or hitting a wall. It's
                also very helpful for your break to not overlap with what you're coding and to not be mentally
                taxing.<br><br>So while you personally might be well served
                by doing a Sodoku or some reading about an unrelated topic, that could take the form
                of a brief walk outside, watching some funny videos, or
                doing your grocery shopping. Or just staring at nothing in particular. Those breaks could be for 5
                minutes or for a few hours, depending on
                how you're feeling at that moment or on your responsibilities for the day. Either way you'll want to
                take a break, and it's also important to remember to not feel guilty about it as can be one's
                wont.<br><br>Don't burn your
                candle at both ends!</p>
