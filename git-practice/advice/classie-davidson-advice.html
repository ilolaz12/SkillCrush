                <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done
                    before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, so don't be intimidated! </p>
                    
                <p>There was a point in time when you didn't know how to walk but look! You figured it out, didn't you? For some of us, 
                    there might have been a time (or a couple of times) when you were EXTRAAA short on cash and your 
                    rent was due at the end of the week.</p>
                    
                <p>Hell... Your car note, phone bill, and the endless pit of monthly subscriptions too! Hey, I get it. I gotta have my Doordash and HBOmax like the next guy.
                    But you kept at it and you FIGURED IT OUT, right?!</p>

                <p>I'll be honest during this process you will be confused OFTEN but know that you are not the only one. IT WILL ALL WORK ITSELF OUT THE WAY THAT IT'S MEANT
                    TO! Something great is bound to come from this. At the very least you're learning new skills that you can use for good... or for evil >:) We're coming for you Amazon! </p>

                <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you
                    have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you
                    to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

                <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming
                    language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that
                    the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.
                </p>

                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part
                    of the process.</p>

                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning
                    to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't
                    totally understand what it's doing.</p>
