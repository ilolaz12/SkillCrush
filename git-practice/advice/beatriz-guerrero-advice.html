                <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                <p>The beautiful thing about coding is that it is all in your hands! You can start and change and try and fail and mess up and
                    win so many times! You start from scratch and work your way up to creating a beautiful page that is unique to you! </p>
                
                <p>Its okay to not know! Most of coding is learning new ways to achieve the same outcome. One day you will learn how to add bold
                    font in html, and the next you will learn to add it in css. Thats the beauty of coding, there are so many ways to accomplish a 
                    task so you end up learning all the time!</p>

                <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done
                    before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something
                    so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>


                <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>

                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming
                    language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that
                    the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.
                </p>

                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part
                    of the process.</p>

                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning
                    to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't
                    totally understand what it's doing.</p>

                <p>Don't let insecurity or not knowing hold you back! Step out of your comfort zone and try coding! You never 
                    know what you can accomplish until you do it!</p>
