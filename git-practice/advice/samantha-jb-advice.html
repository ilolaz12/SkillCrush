                <h4>If you're not creative, that's okay!</h4>
                <p>Neither am I, obviously.</p>

                <h4>Figure out what you're good at.</h4>
                <p>And practice! 
                </p>

                <p>Practice the things you're bad at too, but spend the time developing the skills you are good at and want to do for work eventually.
                </p>

                <p>My favorite (paraphrased) quote is from the book <emphasis>The ONE Thing</emphasis> by Gary Keller: <br>
                "Are you practicing to be your best? <br>
                Or are you practicing to be <strong>the</strong> best?"</p>
