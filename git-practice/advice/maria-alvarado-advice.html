                <h4>It's ok to make mistakes!</h4>
                <p>Making mistakes is part of the learning process. The more mistakes you make, the more you learn.</p>

                <h4>Be consistent!</h4>
                <p>Even if its only 15 - 30 min, try to practice every day! As any other skill, if you don't practice it, you won't improve. 
                </p>

                <h4>You don't have to understand everything the first time</h4>
                <p>Some concepts are difficult to grasp. It doesn't mean you are not smart enough to do it. Everything will make sense the more you practice
