                <h4>It's ok to be scared!</h4>
                <p>When you start learning to code you are doing something that you have never done
                    before. It's a new challenge, and by nature there are going to be lots of parts 
                    that are uncomfortable and confusing.</p>

                <p>But the reward of seeing a webpage or app that you've coded by hand is so, so sweet. In that moment all the 
                    frustration and uncertainty melts away and your confidence begins to grow, just enough that you can't wait 
                    to start the process all over again. And little by little it becomes less scary and more empowering!
