                <p>When I first started learning out how to code, I would have never thought that I can even do it, 
                   but man was I wrong. Just after doing my very own website In skillcrush, I had grown more and more 
                   confidence, and with that confidence grew a desire to learn more and more things to see where I can 
                   go from there.
                </p>

                <p>Don't ever feel like you can't do anything or that you aren't good enough. Even when things get tough
                   keep on pushing, everything will come together once you start understanding things, and with practice 
                   everything will get easier.
