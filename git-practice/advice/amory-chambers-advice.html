                <h4>Your job is solving problems!</h4>
                <p>So don't be aghast when you run into them. Writing absolutely flawless HMTL and CSS on the first
                    draft isn't actually nearly so worthwhile, impressive, or marketable a skill as running into
                    problems with your code, and learning to fix them. The more problems you run into, the better you
                    will get at thinking about problem solving, and that's at the heart of coding no matter what
                    language you learn.<br>

                <h4>Balance dedication with patience!</h4>
                <p>If you made it this far, you have already demonstrated a lot more dedication than most people would,
                    regardless of how much you have struggled! Dedication will be your friend as you learn new things,
                    come up against new challenges, and expand your brain with all the new patterns and ideas you want
                    to cram in there. But it comes with risks too; be careful not to overdo it! Having patience with
                    yourself, and with the time it takes to make those fancy new coding neural pathways, is important
                    to. Be kind to yourself; take breaks, take breathers, and step away from problems if they are
                    getting too frustrating. It takes more willpower to step away and let your brain calm down and turn
                    it over than it does to just keep bashing your face into the keyboard, but learning when to step
                    away will serve you just as well as your dedication!</p>

                <h4>Never, ever miss an opportunity to pee!</h4>
                <p>This advice has served me better than a cast iron pan. 'Eh, I'm okay'. NO. YOU FOOL. If you have time
                    and opportunity to pee, always take it. This is called crisis prevention and it will contribute to
                    your good mood forever in all circumstances. You cannot be having a good time if you really need to
                    pee and you missed your shot because of impatience an hour ago. Trust me on this one. Words to live
                    by.<br>
