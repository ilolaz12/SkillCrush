            <h1>Hi, my name is <span> Rhea</span>!<br>Here's a sprinkle of advice for the newbies!</h1>
        </header>

        <section>
            <div class="advice">
                <h4>Focus on your next move!</h4>
                <p>It's so easy to get overwhelmed thinking about the end goal of what you want people to see but what is more 
                    important (and significantly less overwhelming!) is to just make one move at a time. 
                </p>
                    
                <p>Before you know it, you'll be at your proverbial goal post with a sense of relief because you didn't let the 
                    destination overtake your personal journey. And remember, you can always go back and make changes!
                </p>

                <h4>It doesn't need to be perfect!</h4>
                <p>Who ever said practice makes perfect clearly wanted you to suffer. Well I refuse!! Practice makes improvement
                    and that is all a person can ask of themselves, especially when learning a new skill! 
                </p>
                
                <p>Each time you practice your skill set expands and your knowledge levels up and I find that to be much 
                    more of a confidence boost than striving for the impossible task that is perfection.
                </p>

                <h4>Indecision is a decision!</h4>
                <p>So you're not sure where to start? So what? Who cares?  Whether you're confident 
                    or not time isn't moving any slower so make the most of it! Holding off on beginning a project or 
                    learning a task won't make it any easier to accomplish. 
                </p>
                
                <p>In fact, the longer you wait, the more likely it becomes that you never start it at all and where is 
                    the fun in that? So go on and take the leap, I promise you will be fine!
                </p>

                <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done
                    before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something
                    so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

                <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you
                    have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you
                    to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

                <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role!</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming
                    language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that
                    the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.
                </p>

                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part
                    of the process.</p>

                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning
                    to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't
                    totally understand what it's doing.</p>
