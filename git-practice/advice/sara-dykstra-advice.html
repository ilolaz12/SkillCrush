                <h4>Trust the Process!</h4>
                <p>When you start learning to code you are essentially learning several new languages at once and how to 
                    get them to work in harmony. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and something you've never been done before.</p>

                <p>Confusion, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. Keep going! Sometimes it all makes
                    sense in the next lesson if you just trust and push through. The more you practice and the more you trust that process
                    through the bouts of confusion, the more the fog lifts and you find it making more sense bit by bit.</p>

                <h4>Practice Makes Perfect.</h4>
                <p>Each time you run through a lesson feel free to go back and try it again. You'll see how much easier it is the second time.
                    Your brain is absorbing... even if it doesn't make sense as to WHY you are doing something, your muscle memory is doing the work.
                    And that sets you on the road to success. You are learning what to do to get things done!
