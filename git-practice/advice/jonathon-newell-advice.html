                <h4>Uncertainty Is Inevitable</h4>
                <p>When learning a new coding language or skill, it is Inevitable that you will be uncertain at some point.
                    That is a good thing! The fact that you are not certain tells you that you have plenty to learn and improve upon.
                </p>

                <h4>Be Meticulous</h4>
                <p>When learning something new it is best to be as observant as possible. There are times when you will need to scour 
                    through multiple sections of code to discover what is causing any issues.
