                <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done
                    before. It's a new challenge, a <strong>new opportunity</strong>, and in the case of software development, something
                    so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>
                <p>Take it <strong>one step at a time</strong>. Once you finish, you will have an enormous feeling of <strong>success</strong>.</p>

                <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming
                    language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that
                    the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.
                </p>

                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part
                    of the process.</p>

                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning
                    to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't
                    totally understand what it's doing.</p>
