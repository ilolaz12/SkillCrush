                <h4>Don't compare yourself to others.</h4>
                <p>It's easy to feel behind when you're just starting out and looking at other peoples successes. You 
                    need to keep in mind that you only fully know your own journey. You don't know how long its taken someone 
                    else to get where they are or what kinds of obstacles they have or haven't needed to overcome.</p>

                <h4>Mistakes can have a silver lining.</h4>
                <p>If you make a mistake, but try and analyze it to figure out why it happened or how you can change things 
                    up to possibly make things better for next time, its actually making progress. Even if you don't find 
                    the answers immediately, the act of analyzing and adjusting things will create success eventually.
