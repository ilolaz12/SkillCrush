                <h4> 1. Start Learning HTML and CSS</h4>
                <p>HTML and CSS are the two coding languages that you must learn to be a successful web developer. HTML helps you build and maintain
                    website structure. However, CSS is responsible for website design with layouts, colors, and fonts to make the site interesting to 
                    the site visitor.
                </p>

                <h4> 2. Build your portfolio with a passion project</h4>
                <p> Getting experience in coding should not have to be an onerous task. Start your website portfolio by creating a website that is based on your hobbies or interests.
                    For example, if you're are a health and fitness enthusiast that lives the vegan lifestyle, start a website to share your favorite
                    vegan recipes. Not only you will impress future employers and clients with your coding skills, but you'll also share a personal side of yourself
                    that makes you an unique individual.
                </p>
                
               <h4> 3. Always Keep Learning</h4>
               <p>Technology is a highly evolving field that will always be in demand. That means, you will consistently have opportunities to learn new skills and methods to upgrade your web developing expertise. 
                   Even professional coders that have 10+ years of experience need to research their code sometimes for their projects. Being an exceptional web developer takes time and practice.
                   So, do not be afraid to use free resources like Google and YouTube to review and practice technical skills and methods that you need help clarifying.
