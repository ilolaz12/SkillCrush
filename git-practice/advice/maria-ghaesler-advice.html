            <h1>Hi, my name is Maria Emilia and I have some advice for you!</h1>

            <div class="advice">
                <h4>NEVER GIVE UP!</h4>
                <p>When you are new to something, especially if it is your first time doing anything related to it, it
                    is easy to get overwhelmed and want to quit when you are not learning or getting the hang of it as quickly as 
                    you would like to.  
                </p>

                <p>It is important to remind yourself that everyone who is a knowledgeable professional now, was in your 
                    newbie footsteps when they first started out too! Also, there are probably a bunch of skills in other topics that 
                    you have, that they don't. It's all a matter of perspective!</p>

                <h4>FEELING LIKE YOU ARE AN IMPOSTOR IS OKAY AND NORMAL</h4>
                <p>Even when you have been spending weeks, months, and years learning something and start to get confident that you 
                    are good, or maybe even AMAZING...BOOM! A challenging new task or bad work day swoops in to hit you with a little
                    dose of impostor syndrome. 
                </p>

                <p>This is almost guarnteed to happen, at all and any stage of the professional career-making process. It will probably 
                    happen less often as you gain more experience and knowledge, but it will happen nonetheless, especially in a tech
                    and development role, which involves constant learning and updates, since the growing world of technology never
                     sleeps! 
                </p>

                <p>At the end of the day, it is important to believe in your ability to conquer any new hurdles, no matter how
                    big and scary they seem at first. With time, patience, and sometimes some help from others and from search engines, 
                    you can do this. ANYONE CAN!
