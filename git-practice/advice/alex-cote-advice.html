                <h4>The dating world is a scary place!</h4>
                <p>When you are new to the dating scene, or have been in it for way too long, it can seem impossible to navigate. Well, I'm here to help. Believe it or not, fear is normal and the only way to get over your fear of dating is to actually date, so get out there y'all!</p>

                <p>Rejection, it's actually a good thing!
                    <br>
                    Now I know what you might be thinking, "Did I just read that right?" Yeah, ya did. Let me explain. We all fear rejection in any situation because we think of it as being humilating. While this can be the case, it's more productive to shift our focus to the efficiency this rejection is providing. Say you ask someone out on a date and they say no, now you can move along with your life and ask the next person out instead of wondering if the first person likes you for 45638x weeks or years. Much more efficient than just wondering what's what and dreaming, shoot your shots people!
                </p>

                <h4>Don't put all your eggs in one basket, stay toxic instead!</h4>
                <p>Here's what you need to know in 2022. Life is short, people have loads of options and it feels like we only have 5 seconds to make a choice on anything. So in a world like that, again, you have to be efficient. If you're dating a person and they dont communicate with you to ask if you're both being exclusive, chances are, they are not being exclusive. So do the same, date around, if they want you to date only them, they'll make an effort to talk to you about it so they can have you all to themselves. But keep in mind, you can also be the person to initiate this conversation if that's what you want. 
                </p>

                <p>On the same wavelength, make sure you subtlely make it known to the person that you're dating that you're dating other people. Sometime's people (or men.... I'm a straight girl so in my experience... men...) need a little push to remember that you are a woman who has gosh darn options and if they don't treat you right, there are other fish in the sea my friend!</p>

                <p>Above all, a little bit of toxicity in the initial dating game can be wild. But if you're actually a toxic person and don't just use this as a strategy to initially get someone's attention or force their hand on exclusivity, you should reassess what you're doing sista (or brother or other xxxx)!</p>

                <p> There you have it, some 5 minute advice for all the whacky love birds out there! Good luck Homies!</p>
