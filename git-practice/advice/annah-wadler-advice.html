                <h4>Have imposter syndrome? It's normal!</h4>
                <p>When you first start coding and learning how to build websites, it's so common to feel like an imposter, or like you "aren't smart enough." Here are some tips to help you conquer this self-doubt:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Record your achievements</strong></li>
                <p>Write down those challenges that you've overcome, big or small. You think you'll remember all the amazing things you've accomplished along the way, but you'd be surprised at what you may have forgotten about. And it's hard to feel a sense of achievement over something that you don't remember.</p>
                <li><strong>Ask lots of questions</strong></li>
                <p>When you are learning new concepts, you can't be too proud to ask questions. Getting clarity on something new that you're learning, or reaching out for help when something isn't working is essential to the learning process. You aren't expected to be an expert at these new concepts in the beginning. You will make necessary mistakes along the way, and asking questions is absolutely crucial in your understanding of the topics. Ask away!
                </p>
                <li><strong>Treat yourself like your best friend</strong></li>
                <p>Pay attention to how you're treating yourself and how you're speaking to yourself. Are you being a bully? Would you say these things to your closest friend if they were in your position? No, you wouldn't. You are equally as deserving of kindness and grace as your friends or family members are, so be kind to yourself. Talk to yourself as if you're talking to a loved one.</p>
                <li><strong>Find a mentor</strong></li>
                <p>Having a go-to person to come to with questions will help speed up the learning process. You don't necessarily have to go up to a person and ask them to be your mentor. What you can do is pay attention to the things other people are good at that you'd like to learn. Ask to pair up with them on certain tasks. That way, you can also get a sense of how patient they are and how comfortable they are with you asking lots of questions before making them your go-to person.</p>
