                <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                <p>It's ok if you don't understand everything the first time you learn it. Some concepts are easier than others to understand and some concepts will take some practice before being understood. Take your time with each new line of code until it makes sense to you. </p>

                <p>Everything will become more clear to you as you go at your own pace to figure things out. Don't rush because it's important to learn the basics before tackling more complicated ideas. </p>

                <h4>Don't be afraid to ask questions!</h4>
                <p>Take advantage of those feedback challenges. They are your chance to ask the TAs and instructors your questions about the concepts you just learned. There is no such thing as a stupid question. Having an answer at the beginning of your learning experience will save you lots of time and headaches down the road.
                </p>

                <h4>Have fun experimenting and share it with someone!</h4>

                <p>Have fun experimenting once you have learned the basics or a new idea. Try things out and see what happens. Share your experience with others. I find that I enjoy sharing what I've discovered with my significant other since it may be something they are also interested in. </p>
