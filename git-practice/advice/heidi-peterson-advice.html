                <h4>Don't give up!</h4>
                <p>When you start out with coding, everything will seem confusing. There will be times when you feel like quitting
                    because you feel like you haven't a clue what you're doing. When that happens, just KEEP GOING! As you learn, things
                    will eventually begin to come together. </p>

                <h4>Practice makes perfect!</h4>
                <p>As you begin to learn things, make sure that you are practicing them and then practicing them again. The more you 
                    repeat the actions, the easier it will become to remember the steps and commands you need to use.
