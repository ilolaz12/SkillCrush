                <h4>Trust the process!</h4>
                <p>It can be super intimidating to learn a brand-new skill! As long as you stick with it and practice, 
                    coding will start to make sense, and before you know it what may have felt like an overwhelming 
                    mountain to climb will be second nature!

                <h4>15 minutes a day goes a very long way!</h4>
                <p>If you are a busy parent like I am, or otherwise have a full and busy life, it can feel like you'll never 
                    have enough time to sit down and do the work. However, you don't need hours at a time to make a 
                    big impact on your understanding of a new subject.
                </p>

                <p>If you can dedicate at least 15 minutes a day to sit down and do the lesson, practice, or even listen to a podcast 
                    on coding, front-end development, or a related topic, youâ€™re making progress! Often, you'll find that 15 minutes 
                    will turn into many more minutes and even hours! Thanks to Bethany Meier, a Skillcrush instructor, who gave this advice to me!
