                <h4>Limit your Distractions</h4>
                <p>When beginning to code, it is easy to get distracted and lose focus on your work. The best way to combat that is to clean your work station! Make sure your surrounding areas are nice and tidy.</p>

                <p>Not only do your surroundings have to be clean, you should also keep your comuter clean. Make sure not to have any unnecessary tabs, folders, or files open on your computer. This can often lead to confusion and mistakes, and can also distract you from your work. </p>

                <h4>Get a Support Squad</h4>
                <p>If learning to code is a new experience for you, having friends and family support your new path can help in huge ways! Having people around you to cheer you on and support you is a great way to keep you motivated to learning a great new skill.
                </p>

                <p>You can also find support in others who are learning alongside you!</p>

                <p>Learning on Skillcrush has a huge benefit of community! Whenever you feel stuck or unmotivated, you can always seek out support through the Skillcrush Slack!</p>
