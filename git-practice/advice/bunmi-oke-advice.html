            Realize and accept this is no quick journey. It's normal your
            learning
            <u>will</u> take time. (Hint: It's lifelong.) This is as well a cue
            that you should strive for depth, not haste.
          </p>

          <p>
            You don't want to be some Senior Programmer with yawning gaps in
            your grasp of rudiments that it all slaps a huge question mark on
            your foundational diligence.
          </p>

          <p>
            Your future programmer self will thank you for taking the time and
            trouble to be thorough in your learning, not skimping on
            fundamentals, not glossing over basics.
          </p>

        <h4><s>Binge</s> Build is the Watchword.</h4>

            Trust me, you can stare at a learning video all day, soak up all
            that is being taught like a sponge, and return to the same resource
            a couple weeks later only to wonder what in the Greek the tutor is
            saying.
          </p>

          <p>
            You will realize programming isn't so much about cramming syntax or,
            excellent as it sounds, knowing how something is done. It is about
            <em>doing</em>, plain and simple.
          </p>

          <p>
            So in your pursuit of learning, retaining stuff and gaining mastery,
            ask yourself: Why be a passive binge-watcher when I can be an
            obsessive builder?
