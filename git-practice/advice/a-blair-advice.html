                <h4>Get Uncomfortable!</h4>
                <p>Learning requires you to make mistakes and even flat out fail sometimes. Big failures sound scary, but during the learning process is the BEST time to make those disastrous mistakes! You'll learn from them without losing a client or job. If its real big and messy you could learn A LOT!</p>

                <p>When you're feeling like throwing your computer out the window or start spontaneously crying, go for a walk, take a break. When your back in front of your machine, explain outloud to anyone or anything around. Just the act of explaining can open your eyes to something you missed.</p>

                <h4>You don't know what you don't know</h4>
                <p>Track where you are within the four boxes of knowledge. Realizing you have moved from one to the next can be really rewarding even if the box you're in is 'Knowing what you don't know'. Just because you aren't yet able to code an app like a pro, does NOT mean you haven't gotten anywhere and it feels really good to see your progress.</p>

                <p>Feeling good will help you continue your work and desire to move on up. Small victories are actually huge! They keep the positive emotions going and make learning interesting and rewarding.</p>

                <p>Trust that one day you are going to be aware of and understand what you know.</p>
