        <h4>Working through frustration helps you become a better coder!</h4>
        <p>
          When you are learning to code there are many times when you just dont
          understand why your code is just not working. It is so easy to get
          frustrated and discouraged. If you keep trying and researching
          solutions when you finally figure it out you will have even more
          understanding of programming than you did before.
        </p>

        <p>
          Those instances when you are researching and trying things to get it
          to work will stick with you. Next time you wont make that mistake
          again or if you see it happen you will know exactly what to do to fix
          it. Vioala you are becoming a more advanced coder with every problem
          solved.
        </p>

        <h4>Create learning goals to get to your ultimate goal</h4>
        <p>
          Knowing where you want to be and breaking it down into steps makes it
          easier to achieve. Instead of being overwhelmed by the big picture and
          everything you need to learn to reach your goal. You will have little
          peices of multiple successes along the way to help you stay motivated.
        </p>

        <p>
          Having a plan will help to keep you focused on your goal. I know there
          are so many things I want to learn it is easy to move on to the next
          thing before you fully understand what you were originally learning.
          So writing a clear plan will help you get to your goal faster and more
          efficiently.
        </p>

        <h4>Don't forget to have fun!! Learning is supposed to be fun</h4>

        <p>
          I know from experience it is easy to just be focused on the end goal
          and loose sight of enjoying the journey.
        </p>

        <p>
          If your plans gets set back or needs to be adjusted it is ok. Dont get
          frustrated become you will get there if you stay focused and positive
          and have fun learning
        </p>
