                <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done
                    before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something
                    so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

                <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you
                    have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you
                    to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

                <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming
                    language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that
                    the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.
                </p>

                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part
                    of the process.</p>

                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning
                    to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't
                    totally understand what it's doing.</p>

                <h4>Comfort is the enemy to progress.</h4>
                <p> I am sure that a lot of you have already heard this quote. It is popular because it is true where some
                    things are concerned, and I would add learning to code as one of those things.In other words, what I am
                    saying is get out of your comfort zone, feel free to press on despite feeling uncomfortable with whatever
                    task you are facing. This helps to build up your determination, which I am sure you have already realized
                    you are definitely going to need in this field.
                </p>

                <h4>Code Daily</h4>
                <p>This is another piece of advise that I am sure most if not all of you have received
                    at some point in the past. I have proved the importance of this because this is my umpteenth
                    attempt at learning Web Development. I have had to be restarting the foundational level of this
                    field a number of times because I did not develop the discipline to go at it daily as recommended.
                    So, please don't make the same mistake I did where this is concerned, if you want to keep things fresh
                    in your head and stay on track then make daily coding a habit.<br>
