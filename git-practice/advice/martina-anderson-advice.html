                <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                <p>I’m not sure a truer statement has ever been made. Learning anything in an immersive fashion 
                    will have ups and downs, it is just part of the process. But those rough moments are where you
                    will have your most meaningful learning moments. Embrace that confusion because it will be those 
                    moments that you will remember later on. You are filling your toolbox of skills. 
                </p>

                <p>Lean into those moments of frustration because they are stepping stones in your journey. It means 
                    that you are fully invested. Once you are past those uncomfortable moments you will have a new feeling
                    ...accomplishment!</p>

                <h4>We are learning what now?</h4>
                <p>When we are talking about learning a new language it is already daunting. Add in the thought of learning 
                    a language meant for computers....oof. Luckily this language isn’t the same as being fluent in spoken languages. 
                    When we are talking about coding or programming languages we are talking about giving instructions.
                </p>

                <p>When you are just starting out you really just want to focus on learning languages. What really needs to happen 
                    is getting faily competent in the languages you are wanting to work with.
