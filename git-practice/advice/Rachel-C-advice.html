                <h4>It's ok to take a break.</h4>
                <p>When you first start coding, there's a lot of information you need to learn. It can become overwhelming, 
                    especially if you're stuck. Taking a break and stepping away from your code can be very beneficial. Looking
                    at your code with a fresh set of eyes may even help you figure out the soultion to your problem.</p>

                <p>If you get stuck, that is completely ok. It happens to everyone at one point or another. </p>

                <h4>Make sure you are using best practices when writing code. </h4>
                <p>If your code is not written using best practices, it will be unorganized and it will be difficult to
                    navigate. Fixing problems with your code will be a bit harder.</p>

                <p>When your code is clean and written using best practices, it will be easy to navigate. Fixing problems
                    with your code will be a little bit easier. </p>

                <p>Coding may seem really overwhelming at first, but with a little practice, soon you'll be able to code with ease.</p>
