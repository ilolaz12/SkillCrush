                <h4>Read lots of code!</h4>
                <p>Look at how others write and see how they are doing the same things your are doing. Ask yourself "Why did they do it 
                    that way? Does it work? Is it easier than how I'm doing it?" You can learn a lot from just looking at how others do 
                    things.</p>

                <h4>Errors are your friend!</h4>
                <p>Don't be afraid if something doesn't work out the first time you try it. The errors will teach you more than getting 
                    things right your first try.</p>
