                Hi, my name is Coby and I have some advice for you!</h1>
        </header>

        <section>
            <div class="advice">
                <h4 style="color:darkcyan">Practice is everthing!</h4>
                <p>Find different ways to practice the code you've learned. It can be as easy as finding a few minutes a day 
                    to practice small bits of code that you recently learned and applying it to different problems. Like
                    "How can I move that text or image there? What colors look good together? How can I add a new font?" So on 
                    and So forth.</p>

                <p>I've been using the <a href="https://getmimo.com/">Mimo App</a> to practice and reinforce the lessons I've 
                    learned through Skillcrush. It's perfect for commutes or just a quick few minutes of coding.</p>

                <h4 style="color:darkcyan">Trust in the process</h4>
                <p>When I first started this class, I would go through times where I would doubt that I was making any progress, 
                    or that I was retaining any of the information I was learning. But then as I worked through each lesson, I felt
                    more confident and when a certain challenge came up, I would tackle what I knew and looked up what I didn't remember.
                </p>

                <p>From what I learned this is a pretty normal thing developers do!</p>

                <p>As I approached more lessons and problems, I remembered more and saw how each lesson was building on the last. This gave me 
                    more confidence. Just seeing how the code I was entering was making the changes I intended, also verified that I was understanding it.
