                <h2>Don't give up!</h2>
                <p>We are our own harshest critics when we are learning something new. It's 
                    okay not to understand everything. It's okay to start over. It's okay 
                    to do things at a different pace than the people around you. Just keep
                    moving and don't give up! You will make it.
                </p>

                <h2>Immerse yourself.</h2>
                <p>Learning to code is essentially like learning to speak a new 
                    language. It may involve learning to speak several new languages!
                    That's not an easy thing to do and you are a rockstar for 
                    accepting the challenge. 
                </p>

                <p>Thinking about the process as if you were learning a second or 
                    third language can give you an edge. If you were learning a new
                    spoken language, you would read it, write it, speak it, have
                    conversations with people who are fluent in the language, etc.
                    Coding is no different! Read code, write code, watch tutorials,
                    talk to people who know the language you want to learn, and ask questions!
                    Immerse yourself in the language. You are learning more than you 
                    realize.
