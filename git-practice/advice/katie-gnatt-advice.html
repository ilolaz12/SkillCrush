            <h1>Hi, my name is Katie.</h1>
            <h2>And boy, oh boy, do I have some advice for you!</h2>
        </header>

        <section>
            <div class="advice">
                <h4>Just chill out.</h4>
                <p>Sometimes I put unnecessary pressure on myself to hurry up and finish the Skillcrush lessons. I want to move 
                    along and get my career going. But there is so much to take in and learn! I get overwhelmed by everything
                    I have yet to learn.
                </p>

                <p>If you're like me, and also put unnecessary pressure on yourself, my advice to you is to slow down. Take your time.
                    Go at the pace you need in order to fully absorb this content and these new skills. There is no rush, and you'll probably 
                    feel more confident in your skills if you have taken the time to soak it all up!
                </p>

                <h4>Imposter syndrome, who???</h4>
                <p>I never thought I was a techy person. Growing up, I leaned more towards the world of arts and language versus the 
                    world of technology. When I started my coding journey, I was scared that I didn't belong here. I figured when I made 
                    a career switch, my new bosses would realize I am a fraud. I didn't think I could actually be a coder.
                </p>

                <p>But that's a load of garbage!! I do belong in this world. And I already am a coder! I have been and will continue to 
                    be successful in learning these skills.
                </p>

                <p>If you have also been hearing the cruel voices of imposter syndrome, know that you're not alone. We are capable
                    and brilliant, and we do belong here.
                </p>
                    
                <p>The world is filled with people who pivot tracks and change careers, <span>so why can't we?</span></p>

                <h4>Now go kick some coding butt.</h4>
