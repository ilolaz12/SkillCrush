            <h1>Hi, my name is Hannah and I have some advice for you!</h1>
        </header>

        <section>
            <div class="advice">
                <h4>Don't be afraid to experiment!</h4>
                <p>Personal projects are your friend. Be curious! </p>

                <p>Courses and books can teach you all kinds of wonderful, practical skills, but only by going out and making use of that knowledge 
                    will gain you a native user's intuition.</p>

                <h4>Set up your coding desk.</h4>
                <p>I cannot reccomend enough, having more than one monitor (or at least a very large screen). There
                    are so many windows to keep track of while coding, not having to sort through multiple tabs will save you a headache.
                </p>

                <p>Wherever you work, make sure it's comfortable and endurable. It's easy to neglect your body, but poor posture will harm you in the
                    long run.</p>
