                <h4>Confusion is neither friend nor foe.</h4>
                <p>It just is, like the sky is blue and dandelions are yellow. When you're building, 
                    especially as a newbie, you're likely doing something that you've never done
                    before. It would be odd if you knew everything at the outset. 
                    The opportunity is to continue to create, problem solving every step of the way.
                    All developers feel lost sometimes.</p>

                <p>Confusion, therefore, is part of the process. It's a signal that you
                    have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology. 
                    Keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

                <h4>Practice is key.</h4>
                <p>Practice helps to train your eye. You'll see patterns more quickly. Your choices will become more instinctive, 
                    which frees you to focus on the challenging bits. It's helpful to work in chunks of time if you can. 
                    I've found that focused sessions help me to build on my learning. 
                </p>

                <p>And before you know it, you'll realize that you're enjoying the challenge!</p>
