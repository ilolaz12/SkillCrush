                <h4>It doesn't matter where you are in life</h4>
                <p>When you are young and haven't ever done something hard on purpose, 3-4 years of college seems like a big committment.  
                    But the longer you live, the more you learn that you can change anytime.</p>

                <p>Being afraid the fail is normal.  But not working with that fear will keep you in the relatively the same place forever.  
                You need to learn to both accept where you are and what you have to work with and be willing to fail to help make change in your life.</p>

                <h4>You can make mistakes, but try to learn from them.</h4>
                <p>If you could do everything perfectly the first time that would be nice, but it's unlikely to happen that way.  Mistakes will be made.  
                    Even mistakes about big important things.  But if you can be okay with knowing that making mistakes is part of the process then you can grow and learn.
                </p>

                <p>Computer technology keeps changing, so it's okay to not know everything, and you can keep learning too with the changes if that's something you find interesting.</p>
