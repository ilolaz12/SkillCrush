                <h4>Don't be afraid to ask questions </h4>
                <p>It's better to know for sure that you understand one concept before you move onto the next ones, because at this stage so many of these concepts are building on each other</p>

                <h4>Don't be discouraged if you have to try more than once at something.</h4>
                <p>For instance this is my third try, hopefully this finally works.</p>
