                <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                <p>Confusion can be a daunting emotion to sit with. It can make you feel unsure of yourself, and this 
                    uncomfortable feeling may lead you to retreat back to a place of comfort and familiarity. But don't! 
                    Sit with the confusion. Allow yourself to wonder why something is happening the way it is.</p>

                <p>You don't need to do this all in one go either. Take a break, a step back, and do something else that 
                    will get your mind off of the confusion for a little while. Then, when you're ready to tackle the 
                    problem, go back to it. You'll more than likely have a new idea, or notice something you didn't 
                    notice before. Either way, you should have yourself an "A-ha" moment, and as a former teacher, I know 
                    that this light bulb feeling is one of the best in the world!
                </p>

                <h4>Keep pushing, and never give up!</h4>
                <p>One of the toughest parts about learning a new language (which is what you're doing when learning to
                    code) is being comfortable with making mistakes. Mistakes aren't a sign of failure, but a testament 
                    to your effort towards trying something new. Learn from those mistakes, and you'll catch yourself 
                    getting better and not making the same mistakes in the future. 
                </p>

                <p>All this being said, it's also important to set aside time each day to work on your learning goals. 
                    As the old adage goes, practice make perfect. Even though perfection is never ending pursuit, practicing
                    is a means to that end of chasing perfection. So keep at, even a little bit each day goes a long way in 
                    achieving your goals.
