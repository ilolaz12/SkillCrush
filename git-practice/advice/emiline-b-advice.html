                <h4>Mistakes are Learning Tools</h4>
                <p>As you begin learning coding for the first time you will discover yourself making lots of mistakes. 
                    This is actually a <strong>good</strong> thing! The ability to find and correct your mistakes will be some of the greatest 
                    learning you will do during this process. Sometimes finding them is the hardest part; when you know something
                    is wrong but you are not sure what.  Allow yourself plenty of time to discover where your mistake is, and 
                    maybe get up and do something else before coming back to your code.  Fresh eyes can often make the difference.</p>


                <h4>No Matter What-Don't Give Up</h4>
                    <p>While there are going to be plenty of times you want to give up, remember this is a new skill that will
                        take time. Like any other beginner you'll have times where you are going to have to push yourself to 
                        stay the course!  The best thing you can do is just keep going.  Open up your computer and just do the 
                        next thing.  Push yourself and eventually you'll be able to call yourself a developer!
