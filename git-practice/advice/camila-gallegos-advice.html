        <h4>Your code doesn't need to be perfect</h4>
        <p>
          I've fallen into this trap before. I feel like I need to know
          everything before coding when in reality, it's helpful to start coding
          something no matter how small to get things going. Even if the code
          looks ugly, just do it. It's part of learning. When you learn more you
          will change your code to look prettier, but in the beginning, just
          start!
        </p>

        <h4>Always be consistent everyday</h4>
        <p>
          It doesn't matter how little you code that day, just do it! Get in the
          habit of doing it everyday, that way you will get more used to it and
          comfortable with coding everyday, that will give you more confidence
          moving forward.
