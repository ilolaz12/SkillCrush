            <h1>Hi, my name is Drew and I have some advice for you!</h1>
        </header>

        <section>
            <div class="advice">
                <h4>First Off - Accept That This Stuff Works</h4>
                <p>If you're anything like me, you can get <em>in the weeds</em> pretty quickly when you're learning 
                    a new skill or set of skills,<br>but you don't yet understand how it works.  Here's my advice....it works 
                    - Full Stop.  I promise you, you'll understand<br>the "why" and "how" further down the road.
                </p>

                <p>In the meantime, just go through the lessons, do the exercises, and you'll be fine.</p>

                <h4>Feeling Stupid is the Smartest Thing You Can Do</h4>
                <p>This is a <strong>big</strong> one.  Allow yourself to feel completely and utterly lost.  Allow yourself to feel like
                    you're never 'gonna get it',<br>like you're never going to be able to make it through the class, 
                    like you're going to be stuck driving your crap-car to your<br> crap-job until the end of time.  All perfectly normal feelings.
                </p>

                <p>So, just prepare to feel like a damned fool.  Cuz it's gonna happen (unless you're some sort of wunderkind).
                    You're probably<br>not 'gonna <em>sail right through this</em>' like you did 9th-grade Algebra (or whatever).
                    If you do, rock on.  But that would make<br>
                    you the exception.
                </p>

                <p>  The rest of us are going get to a point, (sooner than later) that may make you wonder how you ever 
                    accomplished anything in<br>your life, because you're gonna feel dumb.
                    
                <p><br><strong>Dumb, dumb, dumb</strong>.<br></p>

                <p>
                    Not to worry!<br>You are, in fact, not dumb.<br>You are just as smart as the rest of us.<br></p>
                    
                <p> That feeling of all-consuming idiot-hood will come and go sooooo many times during the lessons, 
                    because it's exactly how<br>you're supposed to feel - It's how you know that you're actually learning.<br>
                </p>
                
                <p>(I mean, you made it this far, right?)</p>
                    
                <p>
                    In my very humble opinion, if you already knew how to do all this "coding stuff", you would feel smart and
                    the classes would<br>be easy.  Simple even.  But, if you already knew how to do this stuff, you wouldn't be learning, would you?
                </p>

                <p>So, if feeling smart does not equal learning, that would mean feeling dumb does not equal the opposite of learning...</p>
               

                <p>And, presto!  Ipso-facto, ergo, vis-a-vis and all that...Point is, if you apply the those transitive properties from 9th-grade Algebra<br>to the previous statement
                    then feeling dumb is what makes you smarter, because that's the only emotional state that prepares<br>your mind to digest new information.
                </p>

                    Now get out there and go make an ass of yourself!
