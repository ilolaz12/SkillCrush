                <h4>Don't let yourself get in your head!</h4>
                <p> When you start you might get inpatient with yourself or think this will not work for you, you can't do it.. 
                    First of all, Rome wasn't built in a day and who says a web developer is? That's right! No one, except for you, 
                    so take the negative thoughts out and empty that bin so no trace left! </p>

                <p> It is really important to not get in your head, instead use it and other resources to troubleshoot! 
                    To get the hang of things, you should always dive-in with an attitude that is positive and healthy.
                    There is no cheating in code, you can watch videos, read resources and ask for help in any community you'd like!
                </p>

                <h4>You are exactly the person who should be coding!</h4>
                <p>There is no specific stereotype for people who code. Except.. they love what they do!
                    Make sure to enjoy the process, even when you've spent minutes, hours, days or even weeks trying to build something.
                    The journey what counts!
                </p>

                <p>..but of course the end result is pretty sweet.</p>

                <p>Be open-minded, don't stress and have fun! There are no limits except the one you've put on yourself.</p>
