               <h4>Believe in yourself</h4>
               <p>Believe in what you can do. Learning new skills is always hard but as long as you keep going an practicing it will get easier over time. So keep going and don't give up!</p>

               <h4>Understand one concept before moving on to the next</h4>
               <p>Make sure that you understand the concepts. You don't necessarily need to remember all the syntax, however understanding each concept is important so that you can keep building on your existing knowledge.</p>

               <h4>Ask for help</h4>
               <p>Don't be afraid to ask for help if you're not sure about something. Nobody knows everything and if you ask, you will know for the next time.</p>

               <h4>Try out different things and practice what you already know</h4>
               <p>Experiment with different styling, add something to your web page that you maybe haven't done before, experiment. Practice the skills you already have so you can improve and build on them.</p>
