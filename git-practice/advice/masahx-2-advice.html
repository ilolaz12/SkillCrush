                    [Intro]<br>
                    This is a song about HTML and CSS<br>
                    I hope you know the difference 'tween soup and nuts<br>
                    <br>
                    [Hook]<br>
                    All you need is a browser to see<br>
                    that it's not as easy as it looks<br>
                    <br>
                    [Verse]<br>
                    You need to pay attention to the tags and the attributes<br>
                    You could make some mistakes with font sizes too<br>
                    Don't want to end up in the Charybdis of bugs<br>
                    <br>
                    [Chorus]<br>
                    It goes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, PHP, C#<br>
                    This is the only thing that I really know<br>
                    HTML and CSS, HTML and CSS
