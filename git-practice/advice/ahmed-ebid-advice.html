                <h4>Be consistent!</h4>
                <p>One trick that I find helpful in learning how to code is to do it every day (even for just a few minutes). 
                    This is useful in building your coding skills and training yourself to have a coderâ€™s mindset.</p>

                <h4>Have fun!</h4>
                <p>Coding can be fun ðŸ¤©. Don't treat it like a task that should be done but rather like a magic tool that you learn 
                    so you could turn your dreams into reality. You're now like Harry Potter in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry ðŸ§™</p>
