                <h4>Coding is like becoming a mad scientist!</h4>
                <p>While coding is full of exciting new skills to learn and put to use, it can be frustating when you can't figure out why something won't work correctly. Instead of pulling your hair out after another unsuccessful "Refresh", think of coding like finding the perfect concoction for your potion (to save the world, of course!).</p>

                <p>While scientists mix combinations of chemicals and other materials together in a beaker, you as a coder, use the same skills but in your text editor. A few cut and pastes, maybe a couple big deletes, but even more tweaks, your code finally looks right, you've done it! Good job coder, another website will live on another day.</p>
