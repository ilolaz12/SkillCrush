                <h4>Slow it down and don't get frustrated!</h4>
                <p>Be patient and take your time through each lesson. I recommend going back and doing the assignments a second or third time, each attempt lessening how much you require detailed instruction. It's not enough to be able to read instructions and mimic, you have to know the material. The goal is not to study for the test.</p>

                <p>Also, practice using Git and GitHub by forking projects and playing around with commands. If you are like me, Git is NOT intuitive at all! Phrases that seem like common sense to use as a command aren't actually commands. Alter the helpful lists we are given in the lessons to add the common sense phrase/word next to the commands. This helps with memorizing them.</p>
