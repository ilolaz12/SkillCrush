                <h4>Mistakes Make You Better</h4>
                <img src="https://jesus.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/AMED-22.3-min.jpg" alt ="Quote image Mistakes mean you learn faster">
                <p>One of my favorite sports is Jiu Jitsu. When you watch it without knowing the sport, you will just see
                    long periods of time of what looks like inaction on the ground or random grabs on the feet. However, when
                    you start to study and participate, you realize that every move you make good or bad teaches you something
                    and can lead you to victory. Eventually the information you pick up from doing all the mundane actions will
                    lead you to the key to victory against that particular opponent.
                </p>

                <p>It's the same with coding. At first, you will do lessons then you are asked to try to use it. Many times you
                    are still confused about what you have learned because it's still fresh. Exercise after exercise, you will 
                    feel like you are just putting in random words or commands, hoping to sovle the puzzle or complete the task.
                    It may feel like you are just doing to do but in reality every attempt teaches you something. If you step
                    back after a week of consistent practice you will notice that you will rememer your errors and not repeat them.
                    So in reality all of those repetitions, just like jiu jitsu, teaches you something new and helps you move
                    closer to your goal. The real key to getting better at coding is to let go of what school taught you about 
                    the goal of perfection. Mistakes should be embraced because they will be the vehicle to your future success.

                <h4>Grit Until You Succeed</h4>
                <img src="https://crossfit2024.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Grit-672x372.jpg" alt ="Definition of grit guts resilience initiative tenacity">
                <p> I love this graphic I found defining grit from Crossfit 2024 in Austin, Texas. Here is what it means:
                    <ul> 
                        <li>Guts allow you to try something new that probably scares you a bit. That's coding. </li>
                        <li>Resilience means that you keep going even when you are faced with challenges. You need that to make mistakes and 
                            open your laptop the next day instead of quitting. </li>
                        <li>Initiative means that you decide to keep showing up. You must decide every day to keep learning. </li>
                        <li>Tenacity means that you will never give up no matter how difficult the task over and over again. 
                            Tenacity in coding means that you will sit infront of the screen for hour after hour looking at the 
                            screen. If you are willing to do that day after day, you will be successful at coding. </li>
                    </ul> 
                </p>

                <p>GRIT is the key to being a success. If you can demonstrate all four parts, you will achieve your goal. It's out there. Just go get it!</p>
