            <h1>Hi, my name is Warren Whitehurst and I have some advice for you!</h1>
        </header>

        <section>
            <div class="advice">
                <h4>Build your success squad</h4>
                <p><em>"Success is empty if you arrive at the finish line alone. The best 
                    reward is to get there surrounded by winners." </em>
                    <br><strong>Howard Schultz</strong>, Starbucks.
                </p>

                <p>It is absolutely okay to experience feelings of doubt and uncertainty. What gives me drive and hope is the love
                    and support of my family, friends, and mentors that keep me going. I know if I'm having a tough day that their
                    wisdom and understanding is enough to keep me from giving up. Each time, I've managed to get back up and continue
                    and the progress since day one has been incredible. Include those people who will help you stay on the path and
                    root you on to the finish line.
                </p>

                <h4>Have fun with the unknown</h4>
                <p>
                </p>

                <p><em>"If you're prepared and you know what it takes, it's not a risk. 
                    You just have to figure out how to get there. 
                    There is always a way to get there."</em> <br> <strong>Mark Cuban</strong>, Entrepeneur</p>

                <p>Going from one industry to another with no prior experience in tech has been a major
                    mental obstable. It's the unknown and lack of confidence at times that has slowed down
                    my personal progress. It's okay for everything to feel strange at first and trust the 
                    process. Even if it takes time to gain confidence and the experience, it can and will 
                    be life-changing for many and for those reasons, I'm in! Sorry, I had to include one shark 
                    tank reference.
