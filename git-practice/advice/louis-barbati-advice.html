                <h4>Embrace Confusion!</h4>
                <p>When you aren't able to grasp something quickly, it can definitely feel offputting and discouraging. This is especially true if you notice your peers are advancing and understaing material quicker than you are. It is important to remind yourself that everyone learns at a different pace and confusion will be inevitable.</p>

                <p>You will definitely find yourself lost and/or confused at points and that is perfectly normal! That is all apart of learning something new. With practice, dedication, and hard work, you will overcome the challenges you are facing and come out on the other side proud of what you have accomplished! Software development can be tricky so remember to cut youself some slack and keep pushing forward!</p>

                <br>

                <h4>Patience is Key.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming
                    language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that
                    the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.
                </p>

                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part
                    of the process.</p>

                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning
                    to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't
                    totally understand what it's doing.</p>

                <p>It takes a good amount of trial-and-error to understand and then get your code to work the way you want it to. Sometimes even in the process, you learn a new or different way to go about completeing it. So when something isn't quite going right, take a deep breath and reassess your code and after some troubleshooting, you'll reach the end of the tunnel!</p>
