                <h4>Practice Makes Progress!</h4>
                <p>My current gig is teaching music to children ages 5-11. I frequently reiterate that "all great musicians were once beginners," or as Jack put it in Adventure Time, "Dude, sucking at something is the first step to being sort of good at something!" We don't learn new skills overnight, whether playing an instrument or learning to code.</p>

                <h4>Never underestimate the power of routine.</h4>
                <p>I made learning and practice a part of my regular weekly routine. Without that, I would shut down when I was frustrated and it would be weeks before I came back to make another attempt.
