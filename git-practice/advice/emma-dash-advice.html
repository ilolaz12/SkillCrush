            <h1>Hi, my name is Emma and I have some advice for you!</h1>
        </header>

        <section>
            <div class="advice">
                <h4>Baby steps!</h4>
                <p>It's easy to get caught up in life's daily responsibilities and social activities. Your coding classes may be 
                    the first thing you'll set aside. Self-paced classes provide so much flexibility that it's easy to tell yourself 
                "I'll do it later." The thing is, sometimes that "later" never comes or it comes back so long after that you've now forgotten
            a good chunk of your previous lessons. I've been there!</p>

                <p>If I can give you any advice, it would be this. Commit to doing a lesson, or even part of a lesson, every day (and 
                    you could schedule a couple of days off every week, like weekends, for instance). This goal is realistic enough that 
                sticking to this plan becomes a lot easier. Who can't commit to just 15 to 20 minutes a day? Chances are, you'll 
                end up doing at least half an hour. Coding has a way of sucking you in!
                    </p>

                <h4>Be kind to yourself!</h4>
                <p>Oh boy, do I know about negative self-talk! Especially for those of us coming to coding from seemingly unrelated 
                    fields, it's easy to develop a self-defeating attitude: "I'm not cut out for this," "I can't get it right, what's
                    the use of continuing," etc. Know that something attracted you to this field, and although you may not know what you 
                    want out of it yet, rest assured that with patience and persistence, things will take shape. The path will become clear 
                    with time. Find sources of support to cheer you on, like Skillcrush instructors or the Slack channel. Heck, even ye olde
                    Google. </p>
                <p> And remember that making mistakes, although frustrating at times, is what will help us troubleshoot and 
                    retain what we're learning. Screwing up is hard on the ego, but it's our attitude towards it, like persevering through
                    those tough times, that will determine our success (and sometimes this may mean stepping away from our work to clear our minds 
                    before we throw the computer out the window).
                </p>

                <p>Finally, keep in mind that with Skillcrush we can change branches mid-course if we want to. Front-end developing making us see
                    cross-eyed? Maybe it's time to try out web design. We're not tied in to one program. 
                    Trying things out is what will guide us on this journey, adjusting our path as needed to suit our interests and 
                goals. </p>
