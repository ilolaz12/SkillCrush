                <h4>Be patient with yourself</h4>
                <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done
                    before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something
                    so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

                <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you
                    have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you
                    to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

                <p>If you tend to be a perfectionist (like myself), remember - there's more than one way to get the right
                    answer and you're not always going to "get it" on the first try. Be patient with yourself and remember 
                    to have a small celebration for each win. I generally like to yell out loud. 
                 </p>    

                <h4>Have more than one source for learning</h4>
                <p>You'll notice a lot of the lessons have links to alternative references. USE THEM! There were many moments 
                    where the instructions in front of me didn't make sense but, I was better able to understand reading it 
                    somewhere else. Sometimes things click and sometimes they don't and having those extra sources can save a lot
                    of frustration.
