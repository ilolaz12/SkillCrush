                <h4>Keep a Schedule</h4>
                <p>Schedule your learning time in a calendar because you want to have consistency and continued progress
                     towards this new career path.
                    Life will get in the way and steal your time so be stingy and maintain a schedule and
                     keep your momentum going. 
                </p>
                <h4>Watch Your Self Talk</h4>
                <p>Don't be hard on yourself. Just know that you will be confused at times if not most of the time.  
                    It comes with the territory.  Be nice and patient with yourself.  You are learning something
                    completely foreign. Anything worth doing takes time.  You are worth it!
                </p>

                <h4>Support</h4>
                <p>Surround yourself with a support system.  Family and friends can make a great circle of support but also think about 
                    getting involved in the tech community where you can connect with others learning as you are.  
                </p>
