                <h4>When <em>You</em> need a <strong>Break</strong>, Take It!</h4>
                <p>
                    There are plenty of times when confusion is part of your programming party, Don't dispare, that is part of the game of fixing any problem. However, you should walk around the room you are in or take a water break for even one minute and then look at it again. I have tried to just keep at something no matter how frustrated I became and, it always took the fun right out of what I was trying to accomplish. Most of the time, I just had to do parts of my work over again after taking a break anyways.

                    Save yourself a lot of growls and hair (from the pulling) by realizing you need to just get some water, eat a snack, or talk about it (even to yourself). Then, you may see something easier to do than raging against the machines. Kehe.

                    You want to use your <strong>resources</strong>. Whether they are the internet at large or an actual person. A lot of people have had similar problems to what you have faced if not the same one and will potentially have a comprable solution.

                    I would recommend looking up things whenever you don't know what something means. If you have the skillcrush communtiy on Slack, I would definitely recommend their help as well. Getting overwhelmed or confused is going to happen or you wouldn't be learning. Use the people you know, communities online, other answered questions online, or any other resource you have so that you can fix that confusion rather than be stuck with the thought of "......um what?".
