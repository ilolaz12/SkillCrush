                <h4>Four things to remember with each new project:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Don't get discouraged - you are learning a new skill and that takes time and practice. In a world with increasing gratification I have to remind myslef that learning takes time.</li>
                    <li>Take notes - while watching Skillcrush videos and reading the assingments, take notes. This makes you process the info a second time and you will be more likely to remember it.</li>
                    <li>Troubleshoot - Google can answer almost any question so when something gets complicated or confusing, research what info the internet has to offer to help.</li>
                    <li>Ask for help - That is why we have Skillcrush Instructors available. Skillcrush Instructors are quick to respond and extremely knowledgable. When in doubt, let them help!</li>
                </ul>
