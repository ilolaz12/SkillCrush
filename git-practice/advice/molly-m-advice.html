                <h4>Consistency is KEY!</h4>
                <p>Even though we might want to, we will not learn to be expert coders overnight. The only way to get coding expertise is to practice a little bit every day (or nearly!). Small but consistent practice will lead to grand results over time.</p>

                <h4>Growing > perfection</h4>
                <p>The purpose of studying is to grow, not to expect perfection, especially at the beginning. Making consistent strides the focus helps learning be more growth focused, rather than perfection focused. This also helps us learn to enjoy the journey!
