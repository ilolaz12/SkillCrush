                <h4>Don't stop now!</h4>
                <p>They always say that starting is the hardest part... but I'll tell you what can sometimes seem harder: <strong>keeping the momentum going.</strong><br><br>Sometimes your deepest heart can play some mean tricks on you... Self-doubt can come crashing in at anytime. Maybe you stopped this Skillcrush journey once before and started it up again. Maybe you're starting to feel the burn out even though you've only found some time to work through the modules a couple times a week.</p>

                <p>I'm not here to keep you walking the path you'd really rather not be on... but I am telling you that if there's a single, itsy-bitsy piece of you that thinks you should be here... then stopping now is not your answer.</p>

                <h4>The key to me getting this far...</h4>
                <p>Has been committing to AT LEAST twenty minutes a day. At least.</p>

                <p>Some days, I sit down and hash out some learning before I get to work. Some days, when I feel like I'm chasing my tail, my fingers don't do their daily dance on the keys until midnight. <strong><i>And funny thing is, that's OK.</i></strong></p>

                <p>This path isn't just for me... it's for all the beautiful things that I want in my life and that I envision for my future. It's for my future children, it's for my husband, it's for my heart, my sanity and my freedom.</p>

                <p>Find your why my friends and when you start to slow your pace, if you miss a day, if self-doubt comes knocking... remember that beach you dream of, that honeymoon you always wanted, that dream trip to Europe, the time you will finally have to spend with your kids... imagine those moments and remember where all of this can lead. You've just got to believe. Do not stop now my friend, your heart and your dreams know no bounds. Now get out there and show the world exactly that.</p>
