                <h4>Nothing is easy, and that's okay!</h4>
                <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done
                    before, you're practically learning a new language, so of course you're going to run into some
                    speed bumps here and there. But fret not! It's simply part of the process of learning</p>

                <p>There will be moments when you will be wrong, confused, and frustrated, but no one is expecting you
                    to get this in one day, so you shouldn't either. Use that confusion to really dive in and seek to
                    learn these concepts until you fully understand everything. Take things slow, lean into the confusion,
                    and enjoy the opportunity to learn something new!
                </p>

                <h4>Never be afraid to ask for help.</h4>
                <p>When learning code through Skillcrush, you will have an abundancy of resources to help you through
                    each lesson- a couple of these resources are fellow Skillcrushers! While this is somewhat of an independent
                    study, not only will you be part of multiple group chats of people going through the same process as you,
                    you will also have access to graduated Skillcrushers- those who have finished the Skillcrush course, and through
                    Skillcrush, have found real careers in tech. So never be afraid to take advantage of those resources, if you have
                    a question, just ask!
                </p>

                <p>While learning tech can be pretty fun, it definitely has its difficult and frustrating moments, thankfully, we aren't
                    alone in this process. No question is a dumb one, its the best way to learn! So ask away!
                </p>

                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning
                    to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't
                    totally understand what it's doing.</p>
