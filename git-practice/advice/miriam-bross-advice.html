                <h4>Take things slow</h4>
                <p>When you start learning code, no matter which language, the feeling is exhilarating. It is easy to 
                    become impatient with yourself and want to soak up as many new commands as you can. But your
                    brain is not a sponge with unlimited capacities. It needs time to "digest" the new information.
                </p>

                <h4>Take breaks!</h4>
                <p>Especially if you are doing an intense course or a bootcamp you need to take regular breaks. Stop 
                    immediately when you feel tired because chances are you won't remember what you are cramming in
                     anyway so you might just as well rest first and start fresh the next day. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    "The next day?" You ask aghast. Yes. When you sleep your body does all sorts of stuff. One of those 
                    things is that your brain files away new information into your long-term memory, which is 
                    exactly where you want programming language to go!
                </p>

                <h4>Learning hack</h4>
                <p>This brings me to a little hack I discovered when I had to cram tons of information about micro-biology
                    into my brain for my A-levels. If you really <strong>have to</strong> learn a lot in a 
                    short time, learn in the morning, have lunch and then take a nap. After your nap your brain will be ready 
                    to learn some more. <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Note:</strong> Notice, I did not write "short nap". That's because this system only works if you
                    allow yourself to actually sleep for as long as your body and brain need you to. For me, that's two hours. 
                    Yes, this does mess up your sleep schedule which is why I only advice using the method if you <strong>really</strong> 
                    don't have time to take things slow.
