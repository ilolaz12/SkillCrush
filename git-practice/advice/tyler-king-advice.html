            <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
            <p>Hello there, you may be wondering if this is really for you after typing a few lines of HTML maybe?
                How about having to figure out web page layouts using CSS. Its okay to feel lost or confused at times
                because
                even the best developers in the world get confused on things as well. It takes time and patience and
                being able to realize
                that you will not know everything there is about development.</p>

            <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you
                have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you
                to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

            <h4>Imposter Syndrome.</h4>
            <p>Having a strong and confident mindset takes years and years to build. You may develop Imposter Syndrome
                whenever
                you feeling you can't figure something out and you start to question if this really for you. The Tech
                Field is for everyone
                the only thing that seperates us from each other is that we learn at diffent paces. Just because you get
                stuck with a task
                you can't seem to solve or fear you may just bomb it. You will find the solution to your problem and
                learn that you can't
                always solve things quick and easy. Finding the solution takes hours and even days but in the end you
                will figure it out so
                never doubt yourself.

            </p>

            <h4>Best advice for learning tech.</h4>

            <p>The best advice I have to offer is that you need to find the best learning method for yourself.
                If you learn better from hands on or videos or even coding as the lesson is playing, do what is
                best for your learning experience. Doing that for yourself will help progress further than you imagined.
                GOOD LUCK SKILLCRUSHER YOU GOT THIS.
