                <h4>Consistency keeps the motivation going.</h4>
                <p>If you make it a habit to learn to code every day, or at least on most days, then it will be easier to stay motivated.
                    Putting in that effort each day, even if it's just half an hour, can make a huge difference in creating a positive mindset
                    and building a sense of accomplishment.  All those minutes and hours add up and in just a few weeks and months you will have
                    achieved so much!                        
                </p>

                <h4>Don't give up if you get stuck.</h4>
                <p>It's inevitable that you will get stuck at least once, if not multiple times. Just know that if you step away, and come back after
                    a short break or even the next day, you will find the solution eventually. Sometimes we just need to give our brain a break.
