                <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                <p>When you start learning to code and build your first website, you are doing something that you have never done
                    before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and something that is likely entirely out of your
                    established skill set and comfort zone.</p>

                <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you
                    have engaged in the problem solving pursuit and that it's time for you
                    to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

                <h4>Imposter syndrome is not your friend.</h4>
                <h5>(I'm looking at you, high-achieving women.)</h5>
                <p>Aside from learning to code, immersing yourself in the expansive world of tech can be intimidating, 
                    and at times can feel like an insurmountable obstacle in the way of you achieving your career goals. 
                    Self-doubt, however, comes easy for many of us -- even former FLOTUS Michelle Obama. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-46434147" target="_BLANK">(Read more about that here.)</a>
                    Many of us have experienced negative thoughts disrupting our studying, saying, "You're not smart enough
                    to learn all of this" or "You'll never actually be able to become a web developer/designer/etc." As 
                    if you needed another obstable to hurdle over!
                </p>

                <p>Here's my personal advice to allay the symptoms of this syndrome:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span>Learn to identify negative self-talk.</span> That's the very first step in not allowing it
                            to take over. Learn to quiet down your bad-guy brain when it starts acting up.
                        </li>
                        <li><span>Remember your accomplishments!</span> Write them down if you need to. Recognize that YOU achieved
                            these things based on merit and hard work. 
                        </li>
                        <li><span>Know that you are not alone.</span> Many, many others struggle with imposter syndrome (even 
                            Michelle Obama!!!) 
                        </li>
                        <li><span>Talk about it.</span> Reach out to a friend for support, chances are they've gone through something similar
                            and will be able to help build you back up.
                        </li>
                        <li><span>Be kind to yourself.</span> Show yourself the empathy and understanding you show others. Learn to believe in 
                            the person who has brought you to where you are today -- YOU.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
