                <h4>Take it slow & don't forget to breathe</h4>
                <p>Rome wasn't built in a day, according to the world wide web it took over a thousand years from its founding to its collapse. 
                    If you are like me, you are starting with a very very blank slate, no techie knowledge beyond how to unzip a file. 
                    It takes time to construct something as beautiful as the structures in Rome, like the Pantheon. We are ultimately building too, but in our brains. Inside
                    you can find the building blocks of HTML supporting my knowledge of CSS, maybe Git is the ladder that helps me stack them on top of each other.
                    
                <p>Basically, what we are doing takes time, because some of us are starting from the ground up, and that's hard. It's best to breathe and realize that things 
                    take time, effort, and mistakes, in order to create the masterpiece that is...code.</p>


                <h4>Everyone was once a beginner</h4>
                <p>Sure, some things come easier to others, but we all start essentially as beginners. No one comes out of the womb, keyboard in hand,
                    typing out code (that would be odd). So, when we look at people expertly coding their new app, just know they also started at the beginning
                    and worked their way through to where they are now. That could be you too!</p>
