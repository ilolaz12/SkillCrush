                <h4>Action creates motivation!</h4>
                <p> Some days I have all the motivation in the world but for some reason I just can't start, especially when I know the task I need to do will be time consuming,
                    frustrating, or just plain difficult. Then before I know it, it's been 3 days and I haven't done anything related to it.
                </p>

                <p> On days when it's hard to start or you find yourself getting distracted by anything and everything, try just sitting down 
                    at your computer/pull out your laptop and turn it on without any intention or pressure to actually do anything with it. 
                    It sounds crazy, but taking that first super tiny, simple, and painless step without the internal pressure of "I have to sit here 
                    and work without distractions for [#] hours" is enough to get going. For me, just doing something as simple as opening
                    my laptop is enough for me to then login. Then I'm checking my progress and how much of a lesson I have left, then next thing
                    I know, I finished that lesson plus 2 more.
                </p>


                

                <h4>Just because you don't understand it the first time, doesn't mean you never will.</h4>
                <p>When learning something completely new and unfamiliar, a lot of times it won't make sense the first
                    time you hear/see it. Personally when that happens, it's hard for me to keep going or come back to it.
                    But sometimes you just need it explained a different way. If you find yourself rewatching a video or reading
                    through the practice steps multiple times and you still can't quite understand it, try Googling the topic, or
                    search for videos on YouTube. Both have tons of resources whether you retain information better from reading or
                    hearing someone explain. 
                </p>
                <p>We're all wired differently, and sometimes all it takes is someone saying the same thing with different words for 
                    it to click. And even if it doesn't, it doesn't mean you'll NEVER get it. Maybe you need to learn the next/another 
                    piece of the puzzle first for that last one to make more sense. Make a note of what stumped you and keep pushing,
                    odds are you'll come back later with a different perspective and you'll find you aren't as confused as you thought
                    you were.
                </p>
