                <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                <p>When I first started programming, it genuinely gave me so much anxiety that I quit. I completely gave
                    up and didn't look at Skillcrush for 2 years while I tried some other things. I'd like to tell you that 
                    while I needed that time for personal growth, I would highly recommend pushing through the uncertainty 
                    and trust that you have the ability to figure it out. </p>

                <p>If you're confused about something, you're on the right track. Even learning HTML and CSS is kind of like 
                    learning addition for the first time. Yes, it may seem basic and people may talk about it like it's the 
                    easiest thing in the world but if it's a brand new concept for you, of course it's going to be difficult. 
                    You'll look back though and be able to laugh at how silly some of your mistakes were
                </p>

                <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming
                    language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that
                    the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.
                </p>

                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part
                    of the process.</p>

                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning
                    to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't
                    totally understand what it's doing.</p>
