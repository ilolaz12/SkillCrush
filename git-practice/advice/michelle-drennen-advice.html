                <h4>Give yourself grace!</h4>
                <p>You are learning a new language and new skills so be patient with yourself! Give yourself grace and time
                    to figure it out. You got this! 
                </p>

                <h4>Don't rush through!</h4>
                <p>It's tempting to want to speed through videos and lessons so you can click the "next" button and finish the 
                    lesson but take your time to <br> really understand. You may not understand everything but really try to 
                    understand the big concepts before moving on. 
                </p>

                <h4>Have fun!</h4>
                <p>You are doing something new so try to enjoy it and have fun! The Skillcrush community has your back so use your 
                    resources and make <br> the most of the opportunity. 
                </p>
