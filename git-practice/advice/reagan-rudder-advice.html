                <h4>Small Victories Are A Big Deal!</h4>
                <p>The sense of accomplishment felt after problem solving an issue that might make you
                   reconsider your decision to learn to code, can be what the exact thing propels you
                   to follow through.
                </p>

                <p>Know that you will make mistakes. Know that you will have moments of self-doubt.
                   Be kind to yourself and embrace the process. Celebrate your small victories and keep
                   moving forward! 
                </p>

                <h4>Find A Process</h4>
                <p>Think about the tools you may have utilized in the past to help you reach an important
                   goal. Rely on the things that helped you to succeed in other challenging endeavors.
                </p>

                <p>Everyone has their own best practice for learning. I have found that mind mapping, lists,
                   and repetition can help me to grasp a new subject with a little more ease. 
                </p>

                <p>Research what others have used and try something different. There are so many resources
                   out there!
