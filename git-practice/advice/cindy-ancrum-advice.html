                <h4>Confusion Is Your Friend!</h4><br>
                <p>Breaking things and getting confused is what makes for the BEST future developers!
                   Go full steam ahead knowing that busting through the confusion will lead to so much clarity.</p><br>

                <p>This field is ever growing and changing, there is usually no one way to accomplish something.
                   I think that the key to eliminating confusion is constantly practicing your skill set and
                   always learning and contributing to a community of like-minded individuals:)</p><br>

                <p>Did you get that? Forget about going at it alone, geek out with your fellow developers and grow! </p>

                <h4>Suspended Disbelief Plays An Important Role.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming
                    language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that
                    the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.
                </p><br><br>

                <p class="call-out">This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part
                    of the process.</p><br><br>

                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning
                    to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't
                    totally understand what it's doing.</p><br>
