                <h4>Practice, practice, practice!</h4>
                    <p>When learning how to code, it is important to practice coding
                        as much as possible. Find small projects to do. Try to recreate
                        websites, designs etc., that you admire. Watch videos and follow 
                        along. The more you code the better and faster you become.
                    </p>
                <h4>Utilize all available resources</h4>
                    <p>There are blogs, websites, videos, and articles galore on the internet 
                        to help you learn. Don't be afraid of Google, it is your best friend.
                        Utilizing all your resources will help you stay current on trends and 
                        new techniques.
