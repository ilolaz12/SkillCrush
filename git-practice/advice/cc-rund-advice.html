                    <p>As you start learning programming, it can be daunting, you start to realize there is so much to it, and start to question how you are going to learn it all. Most people will tell you that you just have to start, which is probably true (I haven't really yet), but one of my favorite quotes is: <strong>"Don't be afraid to suck at something new."</strong> though I am not sure who wrote it.</p>
                    <p>One thing I do know is you have to take time each day to do something, learn, take time to practice, always be driving to improve from where you currently are.</p>

                    <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
                    <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>
                    <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>
                    <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
