            <h1>Hi, my name is <em>Cat A. Marsh</em> and I have some advice for you!</h1>

                <h4>Have we Got Clearance, Clarice?</h4>
                <p>When beginning to learn how to code embrace the idea that you know nothing! It will free you from the pressure of having to be 'perfect' (or even minimally qualified).</p>

                <p>Admitting that one doesn't know everything about *everything* can be difficult but curiosity and tenacity will ultimately make you a better coder.</p>

                <h4>Oveur. Over!</h4>
                <p>Coding = typ0s. Each fix is an opportunity to deepen your understanding of the development process.</p>

                <h4>What's Our Vector, Victoria?</h4>
                <p>Don't be afraid to ask for help. Sometimes the key to fixing an issue is as simple as having a colleague or friend that can spot the error that you missed.</p>
