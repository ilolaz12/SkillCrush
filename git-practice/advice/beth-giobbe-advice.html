                <h4>Computers are not smart. You are smart.</h4>
                <p>Computer programming is the process of reducing something you know how to do into steps so small
                   and orderly that even a machine can do them. The hard part is becoming conscious of what you do
                   <em>unconsciously</em>. The computer will do exactly what you tell it to do, in the order you tell
                   it to, not what you're thinking. It can't read your mind; it has no intuition or common sense. It
                   takes everything literally. You are much smarter. &#x1F600;
                </p>

                <h4>Error messages are your friends</h4>
                <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Oh, no! I got an error!</span> Don't panic. Part of learning 
                  a programming language is making all the errors and learning how to catch them. It does get easier.
                </p>
                <p>Most error messages tell you what <em>line number</em> the error is on and what
                   <em>type of error</em> it is. They may even tell you exactly how to fix them! Sometimes the error 
                   is actually on the previous line &mdash; maybe missing punctuation. If you still don't know what is
                   wrong, <strong>google the error message</strong>. Someone somewhere has had that problem before.
