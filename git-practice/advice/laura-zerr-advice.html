      <!-- First piece of advice -->

        <h4>Embrace the unknown!</h4>
        <p>You've entered into an area of expertise that perhaps is entirely new to you or something you'd like to develop further. Naturally,
          things will seem foreign at first, we've all been there. Every new step becomes a new challenge, a new opportunity, and paves the way
          for your future success.</p>
        <p>Confusion may be a common occurrence. See it as the signal to dig deeper into the knowledge you're seeking and put your research skills into action.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Second piece of advice -->

      <div class="advice-row">
        <img class="paths-image" src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/4252891/pexels-photo-4252891.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=600" alt="paths image" />
        <h4>Find confidence in your ability to navigate the path successfully.</h4>
        <p>Every achievement along with every mishap adds to the knowledge you are gaining. Know that as you move forward, your skill set is increasing in
          the technology field and the experience you are accummulating will undoubtedly benefit you in the future! </p>
        <p>So keep up the coding. Take breaks when you need it to maintain balance and allow the new knowledge to set in. And show the world you got this!</p>
