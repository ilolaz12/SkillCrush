            <h4>Let your fears be your guide!</h4>
            <p>When you begin coding, it maybe something very new to you. It may something you've had interst in and
                seen before, but not to this degree. It may be that you've had some experience and are giving this a
                real try. Whatever your path and experience, you may have some fear. My advice is to let the fear guide
                you to possibility. New things are always an opportunity to learn more about yourself. Fear can show you
                weaknesses, but more importantly, your strengths.
            </p>

            <h4>Take Breaks.</h4>
            <p>"When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming
                language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that
                the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening."
                -Skillcrush<br>
                This may be new and uncomfortable. If this is the case, when learning something new, I've found that is
                important to take breaks. When I've pushed myself to go through confusion, I get more confused. When I
                have taken a break to let what I have learned sink in, I can return with fresh eyes and fresh thinking,
                to grasp what I have learned.
            </p>

            <h4>All of what you are experiencing is Normal!</h4>
            <p>You are a person, be kind to yourself! Learning is difficult at times, but
                you have everything you need to accomplish your goals. There is suppport; there are resources; there is
                a community. This support and community exists for individuals who are new to tech, or if you have been
                in the field for years. You are not alone and you are
                very normal. Embrace it!
