                <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                <p>At first you will be confused all the time and eventually you will get the hang of it and be confused less and less!  Trust me,
                    it didn't take as long to get to that point as I originally thought it would.   Make sure that you ask questions!  You are 
                    learning and now is the time to ask all the questions you can!   There are plenty of resources to use both on Skillcrush and 
                    elsewhere on the web that are invaluable and answer the questions that you may have!
