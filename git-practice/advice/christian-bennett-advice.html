                <h4>You can do this!</h4>
                <p>From learning to drive, cook, or do long division when I was child, learning something new often starts out as  daunting journey for me. I'm betting it's similar for you. The road to becoming a web dev so far has been covered in a thick layer of fog. On that road, I can only see about 2 feet infront of me. I've found that if I simply look down at the path that I <span class="heavy">can</span> see, and keep marching forward, that without fail, I end up with more and more road behind me.</p>

       

                <h4>It's about the march forward</h4>
                <p>That road that I look back on is all that I've learned so far. While I'm still at the beginnin of this journey, I know that as long as I don't quit, that fog will continue to clear, the road will become easier to traverse, and my dream of supporting my family as a full-time web developer will become a reality. My recommendation to you is to stay on the work. Take steps forward every opportunity you get. <span class="heavy">DO NOT QUIT!</span></p>
