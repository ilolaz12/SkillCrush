            <h1>Hi, my name is Krissy and I have some advice for you!</h1>

                <h4>Learn to trust yourself and the process!</h4>
                <p>Learning something new, particularly if you're a non-traditional learner, takes courage and persistence! 
                    There will be many moments of discouragement and you may want to quit at times.  All of this is ok, but remember - you 
                    are brilliant and bring unique gifts and perspectives that are needed in this field.  Don't believe when 
                    people don't think you're technical enough or this field isn't for you.  Keep going and trust yourself, you got this!
                </p>
                <h4>Find mentors who believe in you!</h4>
                <p>Seek out a community of learners or experienced professionals who share some of your experiences/background who can 
                    remind you that you belong in this field.  It can get lonely and when you're doubting yourself, reach out to those who have
                    gone through this process and who can walk beside you as you're developing confidence.  This is a field for everyone, not 
                    an elite or priviledged few, so find your people and listen to their encouragement!
