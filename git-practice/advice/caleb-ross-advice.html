            <h4>Fail Fast</h4>
            <p>I can guarantee you that this is quite unlike anything you have done before unless you already have some
                experience in the tech industry or a tech-adjacent job. There is too much to learn and not enough time
                to learn it all so just go full tilt in and don't look back. If you aim to fail fast then once you
                overcome that first failure you will come to recognize that all true growth and learning will come from
                overcoming obstacles.</p>

            <p>There most definitely will be frustration and you're brain may just hit pause on you. Take a break and
                come back to it. Keep reading and listening to people or blogs or any resources that tell you how you
                can do it. That's a big reason why I choose Skillcrush. It's an encouraging environment with a lot of
                support. If you're like me and don't really ask for help, well, that's one habit you'll have to break
                because I guarantee you will get stuck at some point. Learning anything new requires tremendous energy
                and
                willingness to feel foolish or stupid. </p>

            <h4>Cultivate a strong sense of urgency and purpose</h4>
            <p>Depending on your situation this may look different to everyone. I need a job like right now and I just
                laid down some hard earned cash to learn a whole new career so that's my motivation. The more I
                persevere the more I enjoy and want to learn more and more. I can't describe how fulfilling this has
                been for me personally. I really needed a complete career change. Jobs and dead end jobs at that weren't
                cutting it at this point in my life.</p>

            <p>Once you have your personal why then reinforce it on a regular basis. I'm constantly reading articles
                that convince myself that A) I can do this B) I'm not making a mistake and C) that lots of other people
                have already done exactly what I'm pursuing. Then the payoff is there too in terms of employment and
                pay. I find convincing myself without looking at those end results make the process so much more
                enjoyable. Even completely putting the idea of needing an income right now out of my mind and simply
                focusing on enjoying learning makes this so much more enjoyable.</p>

            <p>Coding is only as hard as you make it ultimately. If it is always a learning opportunity then never get
                disappointed. I heard how programmers refer to themselves as professional googlers so the ability to
                learn is the key and not necessarily what you know. Tell yourself I can do this and don't let anyone say
                you can't, even if that person is yourself at times.</p>
