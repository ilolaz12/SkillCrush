            <h1>Hi, my name is Kiersten and I have some advice for you!</h1>

            <div class="advice">
                <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done
                    before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something
                    so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

                <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you
                    have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you
                    to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

                <h4>Use your resources</h4>
                <p>There is so much to learn in tech (and I say this as a newbie myself), so don't be afraid to use your 
                    resources. There are so many people in the tech community who have been in the same place you are 
                    <span>right now.</span> Use them. Use their mistakes and their successes to guide you as you make your
                     own.
                </p>

                <p>And know that you will make mistakes. Not because your bad at it, and especially not because you are
                   not meant to work in tech. It's just because you're human. Coding is hard, but you made it this far,
                    and you have much farther to go.</p>
