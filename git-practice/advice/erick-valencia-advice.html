                <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                <p>Yup, no lie. Let me break it down. When you're starting to program your first web app you are doing something that you have never done
                    before. It's a new challenge, an opportunity for growth, and in the case of software development, something
                    so specific that it's probably never been done before. Can it be frustrating...ABSOLUTELY! But, that why it's called growing <em>pains</em> :P</p>

                <p>Confusion, believe it or not, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you
                    have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you
                    to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

                <h4>You are learning a new language</h4>
                <p>Learning a new technology means you're learning a new language. Surprise! When you start learning to write your first programming
                    language, or just the latest framework, you will go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that
                    the code you are looking at is saying something, but you don't fully understand WHAT exactly is being said. So like learning a new language...practice, practice and practice some more till it clicks, even just a little bit.
                </p>

                <p>You see, when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning
                    to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't
                    totally understand what it's doing.</p>

                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part
                    of the process.</p>
