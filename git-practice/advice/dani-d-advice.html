                <h4>Show up every day.</h4>
                <p>Be consistent. Make coding a habit! Make it your mission to learn something new every single day. </p>

                <h4>Start now.</h4>
                <p>You may never feel like you're 'ready'. Start today anyway. Take that first step and see where your coding journey takes you.</p>

                <h4>You got this!</h4>
                <p>Believe in yourself. Tech is for <strong>EVERYONE</strong>. Go at your own pace, and keep at it.</p>
