                <h4>Have a growth mindset!</h4>
                <p>According to Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck, a mindset is a belief about the way abilities work. 
                    A fixed mindset assumes that you are born with a certain
                    amount of talent or ability that doesn't change. A growth mindset assumes that your talents and abilities
                    can change over time with time and effort.
                </p>

                <p>If you have a fixed mindset, any difficulties you run into or failures indicate that you're not good enough.
                    Since you can't improve your abilities, there's no reason to keep going. Or you may come up with excuses not to
                    continue. 
                    On the other hand, if you have a growth mindset, challenges indicate that you need a new srtategy, to work harder,
                    or to take some time to slow down and figure things out. These are things you can control. 
                </p>
                
                <p>Lucily, you can change your mindset. All you need to do is pay attention to how you have improved over time. 
                    Look back to where you began, and appreciate how far you have come. You <em>can</em> get better! And with time,
                    hard work, and trying out new strategies, you will! 
                </p>
