                <h3>Remember to take as many breaks as you need!</h3>
                <p>When you start anything you're doing something that you've never done before.
                  It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and a new adventure on this journey we call life.</p>

                <p>It can get really hard at times, but this can be a sign that you're heading in the right direction.
                  It also can mean that you need to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

                <h3>Just keep going!</h3>
                <p>There will be times you feel like giving up or when you feel like you can't do as much as you want to do.
                  But <strong>keep going</strong> and do your best, whatever your best looks like in any given moment,
                  because even the small steps lead to the biggest changes.</p>

                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning and growing. It can be the hardest part in life,
                  not giving up, but also knowing when to stop doing something that no longer brings you joy.
                  Find your reason, your purpose, for learning and doing anything and let that motivate you.</p>

                <p>Give yourself time and patience. Learn at your own pace. Take care of yourself along the way.
                  Be kind to yourself. And <strong>don't ever stop believing in yourself</strong>.
                  You've got this and anything else you want in life.</p>
