                    <p>I find that learning the steps to become a web developer you must try to learn in the manner of
                        "true
                        comprehesion". And not like traditional schooling, where if ya don't get it, oh well, move on
                        (at
                        least this is how most public school systems are in the States, lol). </p>

                    <p>Make sure you are getting pretty of rest, especially if you are learning material that is
                        triggering
                        parts of your brain you never knew existed. Don't skim on the sleep!</p>
