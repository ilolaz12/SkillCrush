                <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done
                    before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something
                    so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

                <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you
                    have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you
                    to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

                <h4>Organization is Key!!!</h4>
                <p>It is unrealistic to think that you are going to remember all of the steps 
                    involved to carry out certain task.  The more organized you are the more 
                    streamlined your coding experience will be.  It would be greatly beneficial 
                    to have a depository of the steps involded for as many essential task as possible.  
                    You could store this depo locally on you desktop or in the cloud using google docs.
                    This way when you are coding and cannot remember the steps to carry out certain 
                    task, the steps to fulfill the task would be easily accessible!
