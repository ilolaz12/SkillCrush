                <h4>Consistency actually is the key and Honor your breaks.</h4>
                <p>When you start out the adrenaline of exciting possibilities, etc will/can propel you...until you stop. That can be for any number of reasons:
                    being surrounded by friends who can't celebrate your ability and willingness to grow; a draining day job; unaddressed shadows whispering how 
                    much you'll fail; even plain old burnout. 
                </p>
                
                <p>Instead of going hard at the top of the game only to need to go home midway cause you didn't eat 
                    enough, sleep enough, or need to take a dump (full of old toxic friends, beliefs, etc you thought you had successfully digested/processed 
                    that one time before) --, work from the start at creating a consistent weekly schedule. Maybe a total of 10 hours per week, 
                    spread across 4 days in the week; maybe at least 30mins to one hur per day...whatever it is try it out and adjust where necessary (either 
                    adding/substarcting more hours days, etc). And remember to not only stick with your work schedule but your CUT-OFF point as well! It may seem 
                    like you're not putting enough effort sometimes, but trust me, doing some everyday and allowing space and room for breaks as well will make for more
                    consistent, meaningful progress - which is what leads to finished products, that you can actually enjoy (versus crashing at the end).
                </p>
                <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done
                    before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something
                    so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

                <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you
                    have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you
                    to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

                <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming
                    language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that
                    the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.
                </p>

                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part
                    of the process.</p>

                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning
                    to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't
                    totally understand what it's doing.</p>
