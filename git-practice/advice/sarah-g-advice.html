                <h3>You Win or You Learn</h3>

                <p>As I've started my programming journey with Skillcrush, I've come to realize that you either "win" and understand new concepts right away, or you struggle and keep working at it until you do. "Failure" is the best teacher, and often times the greatest way to remember things you are trying to learn. That's when the magic happens and you discover what techniques help to figure out the Hows and the Whys of coding.</p>

                <h3>Keep Going to Keep Growing</h3>

                <p>I started Skillcrush back in 2019, but had to re-start a few times since then. Of course life always has many ways to knock you off course, and for me - pandemic scares, having and raising two children, full-time job, financial worries, etc. -  kept preventing me from progressing steadily. I am keeping at it because the only way to grow is to keep going. The grass only gets greener where YOU water it.
