                <h4>Have fun</h4>
                <p>Life is so short. Whatever it takes, music, a comfy chair, making silly websites, have fun.</p>
                <p>I have trouble rembering things when I study. Like I'll need to re-read a lot. One thing that really helped me was somthing called formative learning. Give it a google. It means testing yourself while you go. I.e if you finish a skillcrush chapter, write for 1 minute what the main points were. Write as if you were explaining to a friend what the heck is going on.</p>
                <p>May things beyond your wildest dreams come true.</p>
