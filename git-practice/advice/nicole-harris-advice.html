                        <h3>Identify Your <strong>Goals</strong></h3>
                        <p>For a career change in tech, it's easier to push through learning the difficult, repetitive or confusing parts if 
                            you have a concrete goal to work toward. If you start at your ultimate goal and <strong>reverse engineer</strong> 
                            your path, you'll find you have the strength to keep going. Your path will be clearer when looking at it from the 
                        other side: the perceived end-point. I suggest really drilling down on your specific goals and motivations
                        for making this career change and keep those in mind, daily. </p>
                        

                        <p>Most people's general goal is (financial) <strong>independence or freedom</strong>, while maintaining <strong>sanity</strong>, but 
                            that means something different for everyone. So, what, specifically, does that look like for you?</p>

                        <p>For example, my independence looks like this:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>Being debt-free</b> --> paying off $XXX total, in education, credit card & family debt.</li>
                                <li><b>Owning property</b> --> having an annual salaried position to qualify for a debt-to-equity ratio 
                                    for a low-interest-rate mortgage on a 10-20 acre property worth $XXX amount.</li>
                                <li><b>Paying monthly bills easily and traveling 3 times per year</b> --> $XXX per month 
                                    for bills, plus another $XXX per year for 3, worry-free trips.</li>
                            </ul>


                        <p>Don't be afraid to <strong>dream big</strong>, and attach a researched, realistic, monetary value to those dreams. Money is
                        simply the vehicle that will get you there. The actual amount is arbitrary. Don't let a seemingly large number get in the way
                        of believing that you can accomplish your goals. The monetary number is only needed to identify where to aim your sights
                        for employment and the steps to attain that employment.
                        Your goals will change as you narrow down what you want and need, and what tangible goals will actually fill those wants and needs.
                        What are the specific steps needed to reach those goals? What's your timeline? As you do more research, you'll realize what's realistic
                        and what's not.</p>

                        

                        <p>I find it easier to continue on a path if I know that it's a concrete possibility, and that I'm not tricking myself 
                            into believing something when there's no real plan to get there. If I don't remind myself daily or if never truly figure out the reasons
                            and motivations behind my efforts, in the first place, then I'm more likely to give up or become disgruntled. </p>

                    <div class="advice-bullets">
                        <h3>Put in the <strong>Effort</strong></h3>
                        <p>In Swift-Water-Rescue (and other technical, outdoor industry jobs), the concept of self-rescue is the prime objective. 
                            If you can't rescue yourself, you definitely can't rescue anyone else.</p> 
                            

                        <p>In a recent S-W-R Training, the following question was put to the class: "When does self-rescue begin?"
                            <strong>John Holly</strong>, a small-statured, West-Virgininan fellow exclaimed: 
                            

                                <div class="quote">
                                    <p><q><b> Self-Rescue begins when your feets hit
                                    the floor in the morning! </b></q></p>
                                </div>
                             

                             <p>Yes, he said "feets"... in a swarthy accent. And, yes, he was correct, in a broader, philosophical sense.</p>
                             

                        <p>When MY feets hit the floor in the morning, my efforts are an attempt to rescue myself from 
                            the chaos that could exist if I didn't <strong>try</strong>. If I just let life circumstances and other people's 
                            <strong>priorities</strong> carry me along, I would be flushed downstream, run through a strainer and drowned in a 
                            recirculating hole. Every single day, I pro-actively put in the effort to rescue myself from the swift river of life, 
                            lest I be swept away!</p> 
                            

                            <p>Speaking of <strong>priorities</strong>... in order to prioritize your life, you need to:</p>
                        
                    </div>



                    <div class="advice-bullets">
                        <h3>Manage Your <strong>Time</strong></h3>
                        <p>Another wise person told me <q><b>... if you don't prioritize your life, something or someone else will.</b></q> 
                            Meaning: your life and your time is a vacuum waiting to be filled. If you don't manage YOUR time and fill it with 
                            YOUR priorities, it will automatically be filled with something that you may not really want.</p> 
                            
                            
                            <p>Good <strong>time management</strong> skills will prevent other people and circumstances from prioritizing YOUR
                                valuable time. It will also keep you on track to reach your goals. Try out different methods... pomodoro, ultradian, 
                                work-life-harmony etc. Do your research, manage your time.</p>

<!-- Obviously, we all have a personal interest in web development, but your time and your life are valuable. 
                            You have to make it worthwhile to spend your time focused on a career in tech. The middle-*person* is financial gain. 
                            Money is just the vehicle to get you exactly where you
                            want to go. Are you planning to become debt-free, buy property, support your family, travel? 
                            Realistically, what amount of money will it take to achieve those goals? Start with an amount and ask yourself, what steps 
                            you need to take to achieve earning that amount so you can reach your goals? -->
