            <h1>Hi, my name is Dani and I have some advice for you!</h1>

            <div class="advice">
                <h4>Take your time!</h4>
                <p>When I first started taking Skillcrush classes I wanted to try and get done with each lesson as quickly
                    as possible. Being out of a job certainly adds a level of stress when it comes to the timeline of 
                    completing these classes.</p>

                <p>Now, I'm a little over a month into my classes and about 35% done with the front-end developer career track.
                    In the past month I have realized how important it is to take my time on these lessons instead of breezing
                    through them.</p>

                <p>It's important to have a solid understanding of each lesson before moving on so when it comes time to put
                    these lessons into practice with your portfolio projects, it won't feel like such a daunting task.</p>

                <h4>Take notes.</h4>
                <p>Maybe this piece of advice won't apply to you, but if you are someone like me who learns better and 
                    understands new concepts and skills more quickly by taking notes, then do that. Take notes.</p>

                <p>Even if you are just rewriting down the same thing that is on the screen in front of you, there is
                    something about taking the time to write words down on paper that makes the new concepts sink in   
                    more easily.</p>
