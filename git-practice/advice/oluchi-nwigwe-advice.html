        <h4>Don't be discouraged!</h4>
        <p>
          Learning to program in the beginning might seem very challenging,like
          it's beyound your reach, but i want to encourage you to keep pushing
          because it gets better. Never be afraid of making mistakes, because
          making those mistakes are how we learn.
        </p>

        <p>
          When you start programming your first web app you are doing something
          that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new
          opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so
          specific that it's probably never been done before.
        </p>

        <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
        <p>
          When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to
          write your first programming language, or just the latest framework,
          you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code
          you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW
          exactly it's happening.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and
          in fact, it's a critical part of the process.
        </p>

        <p>
          You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your
          learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train
          your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally
          understand what it's doing.
