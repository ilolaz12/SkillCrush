        <h4>Life is hard</h4>
        <p>
          I would imagine that I do not have to tell you how difficult life can
          be. Therefore, keep setting goals and trying to reach them. Goals are
          what keep us moving and successful. Goals give us confidence and allow
          us to reach for the stars. Coding is an area where you can start
          taking back control of your life by finding remote work and
          flexibility to do the things you enjoy. So, keep shooting for the
          stars and jsut remember that we have all been where you are. Lastly,
          don't forget that nothing good in this life comes easily.
        </p>

        <h4>Motivation!</h4>
        <p>
          Don't give up! I know there is probably a lot going on in your life,
          but I life is full of decisions and risks. Coding should be something
          that helps give you control back over your career. It should be
          something that gives you flexibility for you to do the things you
          enjoy and take care of the things that need to be taken care of. So,
          don't settle, don't give up, and remember we've all failed at one
          point in this process. It's not about being perfect that makes you
          successful or joyful in this life. It's about having the endurance and
          the patience to get back up after you fail and continue to move
          forward!

        <h4>Good Luck and Best Wishes! You got this!</h4>
