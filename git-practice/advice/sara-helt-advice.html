              <h4>Do not give up. Ever. Perserverence is key.</h4>

              <p>Learning this stuff is hard. Programming and developing is hard. You are learning a new language, and like me,
                 you are probably an adult. Something I have learned though is that "old" dogs can definitely learn new tricks,
                 it just takes extra hard work and focus. </p>

              <p>When you are feeling uncomfortable, confused or frustrated, it is easy to say things to yourself like "This
                career change will never happen for you" or "You are not a developer". The thing is, it really will never happen
                if you give up.</p>

              <h4>The biggest risk is taking no risk at all, so keep going!!
              <br> We've got this!</h4>
