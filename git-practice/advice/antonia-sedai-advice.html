                <h4>Trial and Error</h4>
                <p>You will make a lot of errors, and each one is a learning experience. Myself, being a perfectionist, hates not doing something right the first time. I'd lean into those mistakes though, because that's when you have the most profound break throughs. Try new things, even if logically it shouldnt' occur!</p>

                <h4>Learn to Step Away</h4>
                <p>Don't beat your head into a wall trying to fix that error. Take a break, stand up from your desk, walk away, grab some water, whatever you need and then come back and try to fix it. It's like looking at it with a fresh set of eyes.</p>

                <h4>Ask for Help</h4>
                <p>Don't be afraid to ask for help, be it Google, a friend or a colleague. Two sets of eyes are always better than one!</p>
