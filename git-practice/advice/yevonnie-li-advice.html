                <h4>The Pomodoro Technique saved my life.</h4>
                <p>Not really. But it does save me from excessive brain overload when I'm working on a lesson or project. It helps me organize my time and focus on my work. It also reminds me to take mental breaks. This technique might help you too. Give it a try.</p>

                <h4>Speaking of mental breaks...</h4>
                <p>Get up and move your body during your breaks from the computer. You ARE taking breaks, right? Do some squats, throw some clothes in the laundry, walk around your house, backyard or the block. Do cartwheels. Or, just close your eyes. Whatever you do, try to limit or avoid using your computer or phone (unless you have to make a call).</p>

                <h4>I see you over there.</h4>
                <p>Remember that you are not alone in this coding journey. I'm here in my little corner of the coding world learning, making mistakes, getting confused and wondering if I will ever understand all of this stuff. You're not the only one feeling and thinking the way you do. And guess what? There's more of us. We're all just taking this one line of code, one lesson, one course, and one project at a time.
                </p>

                <h3>And some words of wisdom from Skillcrush:</h3>

                <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.
                </p>

                <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.
                </p>

                <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.
                </p>

                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part
                of the process.</p>

                <p>You see, when you encounter a new programming language, part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.
                </p>
