                <h4>It's never too late to get to know yourself.</h4>
                <p>A common trope in pop culture movies, books, and songs is to know what you want to be and do with your life and above all, be fearless and ready!</p>

                <p>For some of us, this is absolutely the case. But for the rest of us, not so much,and that's ok! If I can be completely bias for a second, this is honestly one of the best approaches to life. How else would you discover new things about yourself and what you're capable of if you only grow within these perimeters? The pressures of being as palatable as possible usually come at your own expense.</p>


                <p>When we let fear dictate how we respond to change or unhappiness we tend to overthink. <i>"But what if..."</i> will eventually turn into <i>"I really should have..."</i>. I've realized, sitting with yourself and getting to know you more can help you understand what you want, identify any fears and eventually start to change those <i>But what if Is</i> to <i>Ok so first I need to</i> and avoid the <i>I really should haves</i> altogether. </p>

                <br>

                <h4>Wayne Gretzky was right, you really do miss 100% of the shots you don't take.</h4>

                <p>Now I know sometimes things in your life can be obscuring your connection to you figuring out what you love and how you grow. We've literally watched (and continue to watch) the world shift into more unprecedented times. But sometimes the scenic route is just as good, if not better, than the direct route, especially in Tech. You learn more, you meet more, you hear more, you feel more, you find more opportunities and you give yourself the space to not only shift or like something new but to dislike things and be a change agent for something better. And in Tech, so many things are evolving and at the hands of people just like you!! Isn't that so cool?!</p>

                <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done
                    before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something
                    so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

                <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you
                    have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you
                    to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

                <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming
                    language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that
                    the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.
                </p>

                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part
                    of the process.</p>

                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning
                    to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't
                    totally understand what it's doing.</p>
