                <h4>Learing to Code is a Lesson in Patience!</h4>
                <p>When you first start to learn to code you can easily become frustrated with how little you know. We all want to jump write into the coding world and automatically know it all but that isn't how it works. And truthfully the coding/tech world is changing so fast it is impossible to know it all at one time.</p>
                <p> So take a deep breath and rememeber every other coder had the same learning curve as you. And now look where they are!</p>


                <h4>Practice Makes Perfect!</h4>
                <p>Well maybe not perfect, but the more you practice the faster those new ideas and procedures will cement themselves into your brain.
                </p>

                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning
                    to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't
                    totally understand what it's doing.</p>
